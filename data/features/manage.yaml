description: "I manage websites. Websites run on servers, and increasingly they
are deployed in platform and application containers in clouds. I am a firm
believer in using these cloud services because of the high availability,
scalability and speed that they guarantee at a competitive cost. I can build
and manager these services for your website. Or, if you prefer, I can build and
manage a traditional, standalone Linux server for you."
