description: "I design websites from the ground up to provide a unique, custom
solution that meets your specific needs. I design websites that are responsive,
which means they work across all devices from the tiniest phones to that
internet-ready massive TV screen on your living room wall. I design using
today's modern graphics, colors, layouts and fonts so that your website will
not look like it was made ten years ago."
