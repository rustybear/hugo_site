description: "I build websites with Django and Python as my foundation. I
build my databases with either Postgres or MySql. But as web technology
continues to evolve, I am quick to learn, adopt and use the best new
technologies where appropriate.  I like to use what's proven, and use what's
exciting, to give your users the web experience they expect today."
